## 🗂️ Projects Overview

### 1. 🧠 Artificial Neural Network using Back Propagation  
Implements a basic feedforward neural network from scratch with manual backpropagation. No libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch are used — ideal for learning core neural net mechanics.  
📁 `Artificial Neural Network using Back propagation algorithm.ipynb`

---

### 2. 🌤️ ID3 Algorithm – Weather Dataset  
Builds a decision tree using the **ID3 algorithm** and information gain to classify whether to play based on weather features. Implemented from scratch.  
📁 `ID3 algorithm-weather-dataset.ipynb`

---

### 3. 🌸 Linear Regression on IRIS Dataset  
Applies **linear regression** on the IRIS dataset to predict flower measurements. Includes MSE evaluation and model interpretation.  
📁 `Linear regression on IRIS dataset.ipynb`

---

### 4. 🔢 Logistic Regression for Digit Recognition  
Trains a logistic regression model on the **scikit-learn digits dataset** to recognize handwritten digits (0–9). Includes data visualization and performance metrics.  
📁 `Logistic Regression for digit recognition.ipynb`
